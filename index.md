1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
   - **The most interesting topic we covered in class was learning about new metrics that tell you how fair and equitable your model is. Before I only knew about basic metrics such as MSE, RMSE, accuracy, etc. But now I know how to see if my model is fair for all groups or classes.**
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
   - **I would like to see if I can modify a already well known model such as k-mean clustering so that it already includes bias mitigating techniques. I think that would be an interesing topic too pursue since models like k-mean clustering and other are beggining to become widely used so it would be important to begin modifying them so that any inherit biasing can be reduced.**
3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
   - **One potential approach I would make to our current project is to perhaps made our EDA a bit more extensive so that we have a better idea how to modify a linear regression or random forest model so that we can reduce it's bias. Our EDA was useful but I believe if we had a bit more time on it we could have learned more about our data that would have been useful for the model making process.**
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
   - **Other techniques I would be interested in using in my project would be to research how bias mitigation techniques could be implemented in a sentiment analysis for social media. Another would be Ad language bias detection where our project would focus on identifying subtle bias in advertisements.**
